# BlockLearning Framework

This code was used during a thesis in order to compare different aspects of Blockchain-based Federated Learning systems.

## Structure

- [`blocklearning/`](./blocklearning/) contains the modular Python library.
- [`contracts/`](./contracts/) contains Solidity smart contracts.
- [`migrations/`](./migrations/) contains smart contract migrations necessary to deploy the smart contracts using [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).
- [`testbed/`](./testbed/) is the code necessary to run the framework in an experimental setup using Docker.

## Instructions

Please check the [Testbed's README](./testbed/README.md) for instructions on how to run this project.

## Disclaimer

This research project was started at [TU Eindhoven](https://tue.nl/). Please cite this work when using it.
